# uhi-photo-spot
 This repo holds everything necessary to run the Uhi Photo Spot website

## TODO
- Redefine the purpose of this page. Should it be used for hosting art in addition to photography?
- Update the collection of photos that are displayed, add new ones
- Remove the reviews section so it contains only true content, not the placeholder fake stuff that's currently there
- Update the "About Me" page
- Update the social media links
- Rebuild using a JS framework
- Change the images to be hosted as blob storage in the cloud, accessible via an API
- Update the client code so it queries the blob storage instead of the imgs being statically defined in the html files
